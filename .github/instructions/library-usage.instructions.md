# Library Usage Guidelines

When using libraries in your projects, please follow these guidelines.

## Patterns and Practices
- Leverage existing UI libraries and components to maintain consistency and reduce development time.
- Follow the library's guidelines and best practices for customization and theming.
- Ensure that components are compatible with the library's version used in the project.
- Prefer using the library's components over building custom ones unless necessary.
- Prefer the latest stable version of the library to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features.
- Use the `context7` MCP server for documentation search across libraries.

## Recommended Libraries

- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
- **Storybook**: For developing and testing UI components in isolation.
- **Playwright**: For browser automation and testing.
- **Yjs**: For collaborative editing.
- **Dexie.js**: For storage and sync.
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**: For unit and integration testing.
