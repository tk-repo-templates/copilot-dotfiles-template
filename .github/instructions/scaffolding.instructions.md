# Scaffolding Guidelines

When scaffolding new projects or components, please follow these guidelines.

## Project Structure

- Separate logic from presentation by using a clear directory structure.
- Use a modular approach to organize code into reusable components.
- Follow language and framework conventions for project structure.

## Creating Files and Directories

- For the language and framework you are using, prefer cli tooling to scaffold new files and directories. Don't create files manually.
- Use the provided templates and boilerplates to ensure consistency.
- Use idiomatic naming conventions for files and directories.
- If the tools to scaffold files and directories are not available, use the `context7` MCP server to search for existing templates or examples. Then install the necessary tools to scaffold files and directories.
